  - Description of my last job: I joined Integromat as its first employee in 2013. Primarily working as a Node.js developer, I was also involved in various other areas during the initial 3 years of development prior to Integromat's public release. I spent a significant portion of my time building the abstract layer between Integromat and third-party APIs, managing over 100 application integrations. In 2020, Integromat, at that time a company with hundreds of employees, was acquired by Celonis and rebranded as Make.
  - I have a keen interest in everything related to AI, and in 2020, I completed five courses in the Deep Learning specialization on Coursera.
  - Engaging in educational activities brings me joy. In 2004, I authored a series of articles on OOP in PHP. In 2012, I wrote a series of articles on Node.js and e-commerce development.
  - I have had the opportunity to speak at various conferences multiple times. Notably, I've presented at conferences such as WebExpo (in English) and Devel (in Czech).
  - I find studying Asian languages very fulfilling. I have completed over 450 lessons in Chinese and Japanese on Italki.
  - I lived in East Asia for three years, primarily in Japan and China.
  - I am looking for: A similar journey to what Integromat experienced â€“ a small startup or an independent project within a larger company, at its early stages of development, aspiring to evolve into a global product with customers from around the world. While I am primarily seeking a role as a full-stack developer, I'm also enthusiastic about getting involved in different areas of the project, including UX/UI design and marketing. I take pleasure in interacting with end customers. A well-funded project with a compensation package aligned with EU standards for the desired role is what I'm aiming for.
  - I'm looking for a hybrid collaboration approach that allows me to work both on-site and remotely, based on the context.
  - I am definitely looking for a full-time position. Collaborating as an independent contractor suits me best. I often find myself working beyond regular hours, something quite common in startup environments.
