# #OpenToWork

Greetings! I'm Jakub, and I have been working as a **full-stack developer** for many years, driven by a deep enthusiasm for **Node.js** and **React.js** technologies.

My most recent 7-year experience comes from my work at **Integromat**, where I had the privilege of being the first employee.
In 2020, Integromat [was acquired](https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/celonis-acquires-czech-startup-integromat-to-accelerate-move-to-process-automation/) by Celonis, reaching a valuation exceeding $100 million.

Right now, I really want to start a journey like this again, and **I'm searching for an interesting project or startup** that will let me do that.

  I joined Integromat as its first employee in 2013. Primarily working as a Node.js developer, I was also involved in various other areas during the initial 3 years of development prior to Integromat's public release. I spent a significant portion of my time building the abstract layer between Integromat and third-party APIs, managing over 100 application integrations. In 2020, Integromat, at that time a company with hundreds of employees, was acquired by Celonis and rebranded as Make.

  Teeta.cz was a popular application that aided small vendors in managing revenue records for the registration of sales ([EET](https://www.etrzby.cz/cs/english-version-609)). At its peak, Teeta had over 1000 (paying) customers. From a technical standpoint, I developed the entire application on my own, building it with React and Node.js. In 2020, a spin-off called [Letopos.cz](https://letopos.cz/) was created, which was successfully acquired by one of the largest Asian accounting firms. Upon the discontinuation of EET, we also ceased the operations of Teeta.cz.

<Experience
  logo='/logo/freelance.png'
  position='Freelance Full Stack JavaScript Developer'
  from={2005}
  to={2023}
>
  Apart from the projects mentioned earlier, I've worked on several other projects with various companies over the span of 18 years.

  Currently, I'm focusing on my project [Yuko.cz](https://beta.yuko.cz), where I'm trying to figure out how to use artificial intelligence and modern technologies to help people learn Asian languages more effectively. While the average American needs 600 hours to learn French or Spanish, Japanese and Chinese require 2200 hours. I'm working hard to find a way to make this learning time shorter. However, the project isn't available to the public yet.

### More About Me

- I graduated from the **University of Economics**, majoring in **Applied Informatics**, and completed my studies in 2014 with a Bachelor's degree.
- I have a keen interest in everything related to AI, and in 2020, I [completed](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/Q4CPQ9QMVCJY) five courses in the **Deep Learning specialization** on Coursera.
- Engaging in **educational activities** brings me joy. In 2004, I authored a series of articles on [OOP&nbsp;in&nbsp;PHP](https://www.interval.cz/stitek/oop-php/). In 2012, I wrote a series of articles on [Node.js](https://zdrojak.cz/serialy/node-js-s-javascriptem-na-serveru/) and [e-commerce development](https://zdrojak.cz/serialy/e-shop-pomoci-modernich-technologii/).
- I have had the opportunity to speak at various conferences multiple times. Notably, I've presented at conferences such as **WebExpo** (in English) and **Devel** (in Czech).
- I find **studying Asian languages** very fulfilling. I have completed [over 450 lessons](https://www.italki.com/user/7721623) in Chinese and Japanese on Italki.
- I lived in East Asia for three years, primarily in Japan and China. My interest in Japan even led me to create a website called [Letím do Japonska](https://www.letimdojaponska.cz/) ("Flying to Japan").

## What I'm Looking For

- A similar journey to what Integromat experienced – a **small startup** or an **independent project** within a larger company, at its **early stages of development**, aspiring to evolve into a global product with customers from around the world.
- While I am primarily seeking a role as a **full-stack developer**, I'm also enthusiastic about getting involved in different areas of the project, including UX/UI design and marketing. I take pleasure in interacting with end customers.
- A **well-funded** project with a compensation package aligned with EU standards for the desired role is what I'm aiming for.
- I am open to a **full-time** employment contract.
- I find the **hybrid collaboration model** with the option to work on-site or remotely according to what is best in a given situation most suitable for me.
