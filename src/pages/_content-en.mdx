# #OpenToWork

Greetings! I'm Jakub, and I have been working as a **full-stack developer** for many years, driven by a deep enthusiasm for **Node.js** and **React.js** technologies.

My most recent 7-year experience comes from my work at **Integromat**, where I had the privilege of being the first employee.
In 2020, Integromat [was acquired](https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/celonis-acquires-czech-startup-integromat-to-accelerate-move-to-process-automation/) by Celonis, reaching a valuation exceeding $100 million.

Right now, I really want to start a journey like this again, and **I'm searching for an interesting project or startup** that will let me do that.

  I joined Integromat as its first employee in 2013. Primarily working as a Node.js developer, I was also involved in various other areas during the initial 3 years of development prior to Integromat's public release. I spent a significant portion of my time building the abstract layer between Integromat and third-party APIs, managing over 100 application integrations. In 2020, Integromat, at that time a company with hundreds of employees, was acquired by Celonis and rebranded as Make.

  Teeta.cz was a popular web application that aided small vendors in managing revenue records for the registration of sales ([EET](https://www.etrzby.cz/cs/english-version-609)). At its peak, Teeta had over 1000 (paying) customers. From a technical standpoint, I developed the entire application on my own, building it with React and Node.js. Upon the discontinuation of EET, we also ceased the operations of Teeta.cz.

  Yuko is my 'petty' project, where I explore different approaches to teaching Asian languages like Chinese and Japanese.

Simultaneously, Yuko serves as my laboratory for experimenting with AI and new technologies. The project is not publicly accessible.

### More About Me

- I graduated from the **University of Economics**, majoring in **Applied Informatics**, and completed my studies in 2014 with a Bachelor's degree.
- I have a keen interest in everything related to AI, and in 2020, I [completed](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/Q4CPQ9QMVCJY) five courses in the **Deep Learning specialization** on Coursera.
- Engaging in **educational activities** brings me joy. In 2004, I authored a series of articles on [OOP&nbsp;in&nbsp;PHP](https://www.interval.cz/stitek/oop-php/). In 2012, I wrote a series of articles on [Node.js](https://zdrojak.cz/serialy/node-js-s-javascriptem-na-serveru/) and [e-commerce development](https://zdrojak.cz/serialy/e-shop-pomoci-modernich-technologii/).
- I have had the opportunity to speak at various conferences multiple times. Notably, I've presented at conferences such as **WebExpo** (in English) and **Devel** (in Czech).
- I find **studying Asian languages** very fulfilling. I have completed [over 450 lessons](https://www.italki.com/user/7721623) in Chinese and Japanese on Italki.
- I lived in East Asia for three years, primarily in Japan and China. My interest in Japan even led me to create a website called [Letím do Japonska](https://www.letimdojaponska.cz/) ("Flying to Japan").

## What I'm Looking For

- A similar journey to what Integromat experienced – a **small startup** or an **independent project** within a larger company, at its **early stages of development**, aspiring to evolve into a global product with customers from around the world.
- While I am primarily seeking a role as a **full-stack developer**, I'm also enthusiastic about getting involved in different areas of the project, including UX/UI design and marketing. I take pleasure in interacting with end customers.
- A **well-funded** project with a compensation package aligned with EU standards for the desired role is what I'm aiming for.

### Questions and Answers

#### What's an example of an ideal startup you would like to work for?

For instance, when I think about it, Airbnb during its early stages comes to my mind. It would be interesting to be part of building the entire platform from a technical perspective. As the startup grows, I'd likely shift more towards the business aspects and perhaps assist in launching new centers in different countries and cities.

Other examples could involve services like Grab/Uber or various food delivery platforms, and so on. Ideally, I'd love to contribute to something that extends beyond the virtual realm.

#### Remote? On-site?

In my work journey, half the time has been spent in an office in Prague, while the other half has been dedicated to remote work, with an office visit for meetings once a week or participating in online discussions (especially during the three years I lived in Asia). Now, I'm looking for a mix of both worlds - a **hybrid collaboration** approach that allows me to work both on-site and remotely, based on the context.

#### Employment and collaboration arrangement?

I am definitely looking for a **full-time** position.

Collaborating as an independent contractor suits me best. I often find myself working beyond regular hours, something quite common in startup environments.

#### Do you use XYZ, we are planning ABC, is it an issue?

Not really. Here, I'm simply mentioning a few technologies that I have a strong liking for and have been using extensively. Over time, I've been exposed to a wide range of things, from PHP to Java, various databases like MySQL, and different NoSQL databases (which I also wrote my bachelor's thesis about), to native applications (React Native).

If using something else proves more beneficial for a particular task, that's not a problem. The focus should be more on **what** we achieve rather than *how* we achieve it.
